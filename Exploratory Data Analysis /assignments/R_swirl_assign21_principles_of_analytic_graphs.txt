  |==========                                                                                                                    |   8%
| You're ready to start. Graphs give us a visual form of data, and the first principle of analytic graphs is to show some comparison. You'll hear more about
| this when you study statistical inference (another great course BTW), but evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing or alternative
| hypothesis.

...
  |==============                                                                                                                |  11%
| When presented with a claim that something is good, you should always ask "Compared to What?" This is why in commercials you often hear the phrase "other
| leading brands". An implicit comparison, right?

...
  |==================                                                                                                            |  14%
| Consider this boxplot which shows the relationship between the use of an air cleaner and the number of symptom-free days of asthmatic children. (The top and
| bottom lines of the box indicate the 25% and 75% quartiles of the data, and the horizontal line in the box shows the 50%.) Since the box is above 0, the
| number of symptom-free days for children with asthma is bigger using the air cleaner. This is good, right?

...
  |=====================                                                                                                         |  17%

| Excellent job!
  |========================                                                                                                      |  19%
| While it's somewhat informative, it's also somewhat cryptic, since the y-axis is claiming to show a change in number of symptom-free days. Wouldn't it be
| better to show a comparison?

...
  |============================                                                                                                  |  22%
| Like this? Here's a graphic which shows two boxplots, the one on the left showing the results for a control group that doesn't use an air cleaner alongside
| the previously shown boxplot.

...
  |================================                                                                                              |  25%
| By showing the two boxplots side by side, you can clearly see that using the air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free days for most asthmatic
| children. The plot on the right (using the air cleaner) is generally higher than the one on the left (the control group).

...
  |===================================                                                                                           |  28%
| What does this graph NOT show you?

1: Using the air cleaner makes asthmatic children sicker
2: 75% of the children using the air cleaner had at most 3 symptom-free days
3: Children in the control group had at most 3 symptom-free days
4: Half the chidren in the control group had no improvement

| You are really on a roll!
  |======================================                                                                                        |  31%
| So the first principle was to show a comparison. The second principle is to show causality or a mechanism of how your theory of the data works. This
| explanation or systematic structure shows your causal framework for thinking about the question you're trying to answer.

...
  |==========================================                                                                                    |  33%
| Consider this plot which shows the dual boxplot we just showed, but next to it we have a corresponding plot of changes in measures of particulate matter.

...
  |==============================================                                                                                |  36%
| This picture tries to explain how the air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free days for asthmatic children. What mechanism does the graph imply?

1: That the air cleaner reduces pollution
2: That the children in the control group are healthier
3: That the air cleaner increases pollution
4: That the air in the control group is cleaner than the air in the other group

Selection: 1

| That's correct!
  |=================================================                                                                             |  39%
| By showing the two sets of boxplots side by side you're explaining your theory of why the air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free days. Onward!

...
  |====================================================                                                                          |  42%
| So the first principle was to show some comparison, the second was to show a mechanism, so what will the third principle say to show?

...
  |========================================================                                                                      |  44%

| What is multivariate data you might ask? In technical (scientific) literature this term means more than 2 variables. Two-variable plots are what you saw in
| high school algebra.  Remember those x,y plots when you were learning about slopes and intercepts and equations of lines? They're valuable, but usually
| questions are more complicated and require more variables.

...
  |===============================================================                                                               |  50%
| Sometimes, if you restrict yourself to two variables you'll be misled and draw an incorrect conclusion.

...
  |==================================================================                                                            |  53%
| Consider this plot which shows the relationship between air pollution (x-axis) and mortality rates among the elderly (y-axis). The blue regression line shows
| a surprising result. (You'll learn about regression lines when you take the fabulous Regression Models course.)

| What does the blue regression line indicate?

1: As pollution increases the number of deaths doesn't change
2: Pollution doesn't really increase, it just gets reported more
3: As pollution increases fewer people die
4: As pollution increases more people die

| Fewer deaths with more pollution? That's a surprise! Something's gotta be wrong, right? In fact, this is an example of Simpson's paradox, or the Yule–Simpson
| effect. Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) tells us that this "is a paradox in probability and statistics, in which a trend that
| appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined."

| The fourth principle of analytic graphing involves integrating evidence. This means not limiting yourself to one form of expression. You can use words,
| numbers, images as well as diagrams. Graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation. Remember, "Don't let the tool drive the analysis!"

...
  |===========================================================================================                                   |  72%
| To show you what we mean, here's an example of a figure taken from a paper published in the Journal of the AMA. It shows the relationship between pollution
| and hospitalization of people with heart disease. As you can see, it's a lot different from our previous plots. The solid circles in the center portion
| indicate point estimates of percentage changes in hospitalization rates for different levels of pollution. The lines through the circles indicate confidence
| intervals associated with these estimates. (You'll learn more about confidence intervals in another great course, the one on statistical inference.)

...
  |==============================================================================================                                |  75%
| Note that on the right side of the figure is another column of numbers, one for each of the point estimates given. This column shows posterior probabilities
| that relative risk is greater than 0. This, in effect, is a measure of the strength of the evidence showing the correlation between pollution and
| hospitalization.  The point here is that all of this information is located in one picture so that the reader can see the strength of not only the
| correlations but the evidence as well.

| The fifth principle of graphing involves describing and documenting the evidence with sources and appropriate labels and scales. Credibility is important so
| the data graphics should tell a complete story. Also, using R, you want to preserve any code you use to generate your data and graphics so that the research
| can be replicated if necessary. This allows for easy verification or finding bugs in your analysis.

| The sixth and final principle of analytic graphing is maybe the most important. Content is king! If you don't have something interesting to report, your
| graphs won't save you. Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content.
