1: To find patterns in data
2: To understand data properties
3: To suggest modeling strategies
4: To find a color that best matches the shirt you're wearing

| Perseverance, that's the answer.
  |=====                                                                                                                         |   4%
| So graphics give us some visual form of data, and since our brains are very good at seeing patterns, graphs give us a compact way to present data and find or
| display any pattern that may be present.

...
  |=======                                                                                                                       |   5%
| Which of the following cliches captures the essence of graphics?

1: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
2: A rose by any other name smells as sweet
3: A picture is worth a 1000 words
4: To err is human, to forgive divine

Selection: 3

| You're the best!
  |========                                                                                                                      |   7%
| Exploratory graphs serve mostly the same functions as graphs. They help us find patterns in data and understand its properties. They suggest modeling
| strategies and help to debug analyses. We DON'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results.

...
  |==========                                                                                                                    |   8%
| Instead, exploratory graphs are the initial step in an investigation, the "quick and dirty" tool used to point the data scientist in a fruitful direction. A
| scientist might need to make a lot of exploratory graphs in order to develop a personal understanding of the problem being studied. Plot details such as
| axes, legends, color and size are cleaned up later to convey more information in an aesthetically pleasing way.

...
  |============                                                                                                                  |   9%
| To demonstrate these ideas, we've copied some data for you from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which sets national ambient air quality
| standards for outdoor air pollution. These Standards say that for fine particle pollution (PM2.5), the "annual mean, averaged over 3 years" cannot exceed 12
| micro grams per cubic meter. We stored the data from the U.S. EPA web site in the data frame pollution. Use the R function head to see the first few entries
| of pollution.

> head(pollution)

| Excellent job!
  |=============                                                                                                                 |  11%
| We see right away that there's at least one county exceeding the EPA's standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter. What else do we see?

...
  |===============                                                                                                               |  12%
| We see 5 columns of data. The pollution count is in the first column labeled pm25. We'll work mostly with that. The other 4 columns are a fips code
| indicating the state (first 2 digits) and county (last 3 digits) with that count, the associated region (east or west), and the longitude and latitude of the
| area. Now run the R command dim with pollution as an argument to see how long the table is.

> dim(pollution)
[1] 576   5

| All that practice is paying off!
  |=================                                                                                                             |  13%
| So there are 576 entries in pollution. We'd like to investigate the question "Are there any counties in the U.S. that exceed that national standard (12 micro
| grams per cubic meter) for fine particle pollution?" We'll look at several one dimensional summaries of the data to investigate this question.

...
  |==================                                                                                                            |  15%
| The first technique uses the R command summary, a 5-number summary which returns 6 numbers. Run it now with the pm25 column of pollution as its argument.
| Recall that the construct for this is pollution$pm25.

> summary(pollution$pm25)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  3.383   8.549  10.047   9.836  11.356  18.441 

| Perseverance, that's the answer.
  |====================                                                                                                          |  16%
| This shows us basic info about the pm25 data, namely its Minimum (0 percentile) and Maximum (100 percentile) values, and three Quartiles of the data. These
| last indicate the pollution measures at which 25%, 50%, and 75% of the counties fall below. In addition to these 5 numbers we see the Mean or average measure
| of particulate pollution across the 576 counties.

...
  |======================                                                                                                        |  17%
| Half the measured counties have a pollution level less than or equal to what number of micrograms per cubic meter?

1: 8.549
2: 9.836
3: 10.050
4: 11.360

Selection: 3

| That's a job well done!
  |========================                                                                                                      |  19%
| To save you a lot of typing we've saved off pollution$pm25 for you in the variable ppm. You can use ppm now in place of the longer expression. Try it now as
| the argument of the R command quantile. See how the results look a lot like the results of the output of the summary command.

> quantile(pmm)
Error in quantile(pmm) : object 'pmm' not found
> quantile(ppm)
       0%       25%       50%       75%      100% 
 3.382626  8.548799 10.046697 11.356012 18.440731 

| That's correct!
  |=========================                                                                                                     |  20%
| See how the results are similar to those returned by summary? Quantile gives the quartiles, right? What is the one value missing from this quantile output
| that summary gave you?

1: the maximum value
2: the median
3: the minimum value
4: the mean

Selection: 4

| That's the answer I was looking for.
  |===========================                                                                                                   |  21%
| Now we'll plot a picture, specifically a boxplot. Run the R command boxplot with ppm as an input. Also specify the color parameter col equal to "blue".

> boxplot(ppm, col="blue")

| Nice work!
  |=============================                                                                                                 |  23%
| The boxplot shows us the same quartile data that summary and quantile did. The lower and upper edges of the blue box respectively show the values of the 25%
| and 75% quantiles.

...
  |==============================                                                                                                |  24%
| What do you think the horizontal line inside the box represents?

1: the maximum value
2: the median
3: the mean
4: the minimum value

Selection: 2

| Great job!
  |================================                                                                                              |  25%
| The "whiskers" of the box (the vertical lines extending above and below the box) relate to the range parameter of boxplot, which we let default to the value
| 1.5 used by R. The height of the box is the interquartile range, the difference between the 75th and 25th quantiles. In this case that difference is 2.8. The
| whiskers are drawn to be a length of range*2.8 or 1.5*2.8. This shows us roughly how many, if any, data points are outliers, that is, beyond this range of
| values.

...
  |==================================                                                                                            |  27%
| Note that boxplot is part of R's base plotting package. A nice feature that this package provides is its ability to overlay features. That is, you can add to
| (annotate) an existing plot.

...
  |===================================                                                                                           |  28%
| To see this, run the R command abline with the argument h equal to 12. Recall that 12 is the EPA standard for air quality.

> abline(h=12)
Error in int_abline(a = a, b = b, h = h, v = v, untf = untf, ...) : 
  plot.new has not been called yet
> boxplot(ppm, col="blue")

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type abline(h = 12) at the command prompt.

> abline(h=12)

| You got it!
  |=====================================                                                                                         |  29%
| What do you think this command did?

1: hid 12 random data points
2: drew a horizontal line at 12
3: nothing
4: drew a vertical line at 12

Selection: 2

| You are amazing!
  |=======================================                                                                                       |  31%
| So abline "adds one or more straight lines through the current plot." We see from the plot that the bulk of the measured counties comply with the standard
| since they fall under the line marking that standard.

...
  |========================================                                                                                      |  32%
| Now use the R command hist (another function from the base package) with the argument ppm. Specify the color parameter col equal to "green". This will plot a
| histogram of the data.

> hist(ppm, col = "green")

| You are really on a roll!
  |==========================================                                                                                    |  33%
| The histogram gives us a little more detailed information about our data, specifically the distribution of the pollution counts, or how many counties fall
| into each bucket of measurements.

...
  |============================================                                                                                  |  35%
| What are the most frequent pollution counts?

1: between 12 and 14
2: under 5
3: between 9 and 12
4: between 6 and 8

Selection: 3

| You nailed it! Good job!
  |=============================================                                                                                 |  36%
| Now run the R command rug with the argument ppm.

> rug(ppm)

| You got it!
  |===============================================                                                                               |  37%
| This one-dimensional plot, with its grayscale representation, gives you a little more detailed information about how many data points are in each bucket and
| where they lie within the bucket. It shows (through density of tick marks) that the greatest concentration of counties has between 9 and 12 micrograms per
| cubic meter just as the histogram did.

...
  |=================================================                                                                             |  39%
| To illustrate this a little more, we've defined for you two vectors, high and low, containing pollution data of high (greater than 15) and low (less than 5)
| values respectively. Look at low now and see how it relates to the output of rug.

| Again, we see one data point greater than 18, one between 17 and 18, several between 16 and 17 and two between 15 and 16, verifying what rug indicated.

...
  |======================================================                                                                        |  43%
| Now rerun hist with 3 arguments, ppm as its first, col equal to "green", and the argument breaks equal to 100.

> hist(ppm, col = "green", breaks =100)

| You are really on a roll!
  |=======================================================                                                                       |  44%
| What do you think the breaks argument specifies in this case?

1: the number of stars in the sky
2: the number of counties exceeding the EPA standard
3: the number of data points to graph
4: the number of buckets to split the data into

| So this histogram with more buckets is not nearly as smooth as the preceding one. In fact, it's a little too noisy to see the distribution clearly. When
| you're plotting histograms you might have to experiment with the argument breaks to get a good idea of your data's distribution. For fun now, rerun the R

| Now run the command abline with the argument v equal to 12 and the argument lwd equal to 2.

> abline(v=12 , lwd =2)

| Nice work!
  |================================================================                                                              |  51%
| See the vertical line at 12? Not very visible, is it, even though you specified a line width of 2? Run abline with the argument v equal to median(ppm), the
| argument col equal to "magenta", and the argument lwd equal to 4.

> abline(v=median(ppm) , col="magenta",lwd =4)

| You are amazing!
  |==================================================================                                                            |  52%
| Better, right? Thicker and more of a contrast in color. This shows that although the median (50%) is below the standard, there are a fair number of counties
| in the U.S that have pollution levels higher than the standard.

...
  |===================================================================                                                           |  53%
| Now recall that our pollution data had 5 columns of information. So far we've only looked at the pm25 column. We can also look at other information. To
| remind yourself what's there run the R command names with pollution as the argument.

> names(pollution)
[1] "pm25"      "fips"      "region"    "longitude" "latitude" 

| All that practice is paying off!
  |=====================================================================                                                         |  55%
| Longitude and latitude don't sound interesting, and each fips is unique since it identifies states (first 2 digits) and counties (last 3 digits). Let's look
| at the region column to see what's there. Run the R command table on this column. Use the construct pollution$region. Store the result in the variable reg.

> reg <- table(pollution$region)

| That's a job well done!
  |=======================================================================                                                       |  56%
| Look at reg now.

| Lot more counties in the east than west. We'll use the R command barplot (another type of one-dimensional summary) to plot this information. Call barplot
| with reg as its first argument, the argument col equal to "wheat", and the argument main equal to the string "Number of Counties in Each Region".

> barplot(reg, col ="wheat", main = "Number of Counties in Each Region")

| You are doing so well!

| Excellent work!

| So we've seen several examples of one-dimensional graphs that summarize data. Two dimensional graphs include scatterplots, multiple graphs which we'll see
| more examples of, and overlayed one-dimensional plots which the R packages such as lattice and ggplot2 provide.

...
  |=============================================================================                                                 |  61%
| Some graphs have more than two-dimensions. These include overlayed or multiple two-dimensional plots and spinning plots. Some three-dimensional plots are
| tricky to understand so have limited applications. We'll see some examples now of more complicated graphs, in particular, we'll show two graphs together.

...
  |===============================================================================                                               |  63%
| First we'll show how R, in one line and using base plotting, can display multiple boxplots. We simply specify that we want to see the pollution data as a
| function of region. We know that our pollution data characterized each of the 576 entries as belonging to one of two regions (east and west).

...
  |=================================================================================                                             |  64%
| We use the R formula y ~ x to show that y (in this case pm25) depends on x (region). Since both come from the same data frame (pollution) we can specify a
| data argument set equal to pollution. By doing this, we don't have to type pollution$pm25 (or ppm) and pollution$region. We can just specify the formula
| pm25~region. Call boxplot now with this formula as its argument, data equal to pollution, and col equal to "red".

> boxplot( pm25~region, data = pollution, col="red")

| All that hard work is paying off!
  |==================================================================================                                            |  65%
| Two for the price of one! Similarly we can plot multiple histograms in one plot, though to do this we have to use more than one R command. First we have to
| set up the plot window with the R command par which specifies how we want to lay out the plots, say one above the other. We also use par to specify margins,
| a 4-long vector which indicates the number of lines for the bottom, left, top and right. Type the R command par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1)) now. Don't
| expect to see any new result.

> par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1))

| All that hard work is paying off!
  |====================================================================================                                          |  67%
| So we set up the plot window for two rows and one column with the mfrow argument. The mar argument set up the margins. Before we plot the histograms let's
| explore the R command subset which, not surprisingly, "returns subsets of vectors, matrices or data frames which meet conditions". We'll use subset to pull
| off the data we want to plot. Call subset now with pollution as its first argument and a boolean expression testing region for equality with the string
| "east". Put the result in the variable east.

> east <- subset(pollution =="east")

| Not quite! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type east <- subset(pollution,region=="east") at the command prompt.

> east <- subset(pollution,region=="east")

| You are amazing!
  |======================================================================================                                        |  68%
| Use head to look at the first few entries of east.

> head(east)
       pm25  fips region longitude latitude
1  9.771185 01003   east -87.74826 30.59278
2  9.993817 01027   east -85.84286 33.26581
3 10.688618 01033   east -87.72596 34.73148
4 11.337424 01049   east -85.79892 34.45913
5 12.119764 01055   east -86.03212 34.01860
6 10.827805 01069   east -85.35039 31.18973

| You got it right!
  |=======================================================================================                                       |  69%
| So east holds more information than we need. We just want to plot a histogram with the pm25 portion. Call hist now with the pm25 portion of east as its first
| argument and col equal to "green" as its second.

> hist(pm25, east$pm25, col = "green")
Error in hist(pm25, east$pm25, col = "green") : object 'pm25' not found
> ist(east, east$pm25, col = "green")
Error in ist(east, east$pm25, col = "green") : 
  could not find function "ist"
> hist(east, east$pm25, col = "green")
Error in hist.default(east, east$pm25, col = "green") : 
  'x' must be numeric
> hist( east$pm25, col = "green")

| Keep up the great work!
  |=========================================================================================                                     |  71%
| See? The command par told R we were going to have one column with 2 rows, so it placed this histogram in the top position.

...
  |===========================================================================================                                   |  72%
| Now, here's a challenge for you. Plot the histogram of the counties from the west using just one R command. Let the appropriate subset command (with the pm25
| portion specified) be the first argument and col (equal to "green") the second.  To cut down on your typing, use the up arrow key to get your last command
| and replace "east" with the subset command. Make sure the boolean argument checks for equality between region and "west".

> hist(subset(pollution,region=="west")$pm25,col="green")

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!
  |============================================================================================                                  |  73%
| See how R does all the labeling for you? Notice that the titles are different since we used different commands for the two plots. Let's look at some scatter
| plots now.

...
  |==============================================================================================                                |  75%
| Scatter plots are two-dimensional plots which show the relationship between two variables, usually x and y. Let's look at a scatterplot showing the
| relationship between latitude and the pm25 data. We'll use plot, a function from R's base plotting package.

...
  |================================================================================================                              |  76%
| We've seen that we can use a function call as an argument when calling another function. We'll do this again when we call plot with the arguments latitude
| and pm25 which are both from our data frame pollution. We'll call plot from inside the R command with which evaluates "an R expression in an environment
| constructed from data". We'll use pollution as the first argument to with and the call to plot as the second. This allows us to avoid typing "pollution$"
| before the arguments to plot, so it saves us some typing and adds to your base of R knowledge. Try this now.

> with(pollution, plot)
function (x, y, ...) 
UseMethod("plot")
<bytecode: 0x7fb803c80ff0>
<environment: namespace:graphics>

| Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25)) at the command prompt.

> ith(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25))
Error in ith(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25)) : 
  could not find function "ith"
> with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25))

| Great job!
  |=================================================================================================                             |  77%
| Note that the first argument is plotted along the x-axis and the second along the y. Now use abline to add a horizontal line at 12. Use two additional
| arguments, lwd equal to 2 and lty also equal to 2. See what happens.

> abline(h=12, lwd =2, lty=2)

| All that hard work is paying off!
  |===================================================================================================                           |  79%
| See how lty=2 made the line dashed? Now let's replot the scatterplot. This time, instead of using with, call plot directly with 3 arguments. The first 2 are
| pollution$latitude and ppm. The third argument, col, we'll use to add color and more information to our plot. Set this argument (col) equal to
| pollution$region and see what happens.

> plot(pollution(latitude,ppm),col = pollution$region)
Error in pollution(latitude, ppm) : could not find function "pollution"
> plot(pollution$latitude,pollution$ppm,col = pollution$region)

| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type plot(pollution$latitude, ppm, col = pollution$region) at the command prompt.

> plot(pollution$latitude, ppm, col = pollution$region)

| Excellent work!

| We've got two colors on the map to distinguish between counties in the east and those in the west. Can we figure out which color is east and which west? See
| that the high (greater than 50) and low (less than 25) latitudes are both red. Latitudes indicate distance from the equator, so which half of the U.S. (east
| or west) has counties at the extreme north and south?

| Let's plot two scatterplots distinguished by region.

...
  |============================================================================================================                  |  85%
| As we did with multiple histograms, we first have to set up the plot window with the R command par. This time, let's plot the scatterplots side by side (one
| row and two columns). We also need to use different margins. Type the R command par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1)) now. Don't expect to see any new
| result.

> par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1))

| For the first scatterplot, on the left, we'll plot the latitudes and pm25 counts from the west. We already pulled out the information for the counties in the
| east. Let's now get the information for the counties from the west. Create the variable west by using the subset command with pollution as the first argument
| and the appropriate boolean as the second.

> west <- subset(pollution, region = "west")
