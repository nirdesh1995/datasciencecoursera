| In another lesson, we gave you an overview of the three plotting systems in R. In this lesson we'll focus on the lattice plotting system.  As we did with the
| base plotting system, we'll focus on using lattice to create graphics on the screen device rather than another graphics device.

...
  |====                                                                                                                                                  |   3%
| The lattice plotting system is completely separate and independent of the base plotting system. It's an add-on package so it has to be explicitly loaded with
| a call to the R function library. We've done this for you. The R Documentation tells us that lattice "is an implementation of Trellis graphics for R. It is a
| powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system with an emphasis on multivariate data."

...
  |=======                                                                                                                                               |   4%
| Lattice is implemented using two packages. The first is called, not surprisingly, lattice, and it contains code for producing Trellis graphics. Some of the
| functions in this package are the higher level functions which you, the user, would call. These include xyplot, bwplot, and levelplot.

...
  |=========                                                                                                                                             |   6%
| If xyplot produces a scatterplot, what kind of plot does bwplot produce?

1: bad and wonderful
2: box and whisker
3: big and whittle
4: black and white

Selection: 2

| That's a job well done!
  |===========                                                                                                                                           |   7%
| The second package in the lattice system is grid which contains the low-level functions upon which the lattice package is built. You, the user, seldom call
| functions from the grid package directly.

...
  |=============                                                                                                                                         |   9%
| Unlike base plotting, the lattice system does not have a "two-phase" aspect with separate plotting and annotation. Instead all plotting and annotation is
| done at once with a single function call.

...
  |================                                                                                                                                      |  10%
| The lattice system, as the base does, provides several different plotting functions. These include xyplot for creating scatterplots, bwplot for
| box-and-whiskers plots or boxplots, and histogram for histograms. There are several others (stripplot, dotplot, splom and levelplot), which we won't cover
| here.

...
  |==================                                                                                                                                    |  12%
| Lattice functions generally take a formula for their first argument, usually of the form y ~ x. This indicates that y depends on x, so in a scatterplot y
| would be plotted on the y-axis and x on the x-axis.

...
  |====================                                                                                                                                  |  13%
| Here's an example of typical lattice plot call, xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data). The f and g represent the optional conditioning variables. The * represents
| interaction between them. Remember when we said that lattice is good for plotting multivariate data? That's where these conditioning variables come into
| play.

...
  |======================                                                                                                                                |  15%
| The second argument is the data frame or list from which the variables in the formula should be looked up.  If no data frame or list is passed, then the
| parent frame is used. If no other arguments are passed, the default values are used.

...
  |=========================                                                                                                                             |  16%
| Recall the airquality data we've used before. We've loaded it again for you. To remind yourself what it looks like run the R command head with airquality as
| an argument to see what the data looks like.

| You are amazing!
  |===========================                                                                                                                           |  18%
| Now try running xyplot with the formula Ozone~Wind as the first argument and the second argument data set equal to airquality.

> xyplot(Ozone~wind, data = airquality)
Error in eval(varsRHS[[1]], data, env) : object 'wind' not found
> xyplot(Ozone~Wind, data = airquality)

| Excellent job!
  |=============================                                                                                                                         |  19%
| Look vaguely familiar? The dots are blue, instead of black, but lattice labeled the axes for you. You can use some of the same graphical parameters (e.g.,
| pch and col) that you used in the base package in calls to lattice functions.

...
  |===============================                                                                                                                       |  21%
| Now rerun xyplot with the formula Ozone~Wind as the first argument and the second argument data set equal to airquality (use the up arrow to save typing).
| This time add the arguments col set equal to "red", pch set equal to 8, and main set equal to "Big Apple Data".

> xyplot(Ozone~Wind, data = airquality, col= "red", pch = 8, main = "Big Apple Data")

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality, pch=8, col="red", main="Big Apple Data") at the command prompt.

> xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality, pch=8, col="red", main="Big Apple Data")

| Keep up the great work!
  |==================================                                                                                                                    |  22%
| Red snowflakes are cool, right? Now that you’ve seen the basic xyplot() and some of its arguments, you might want to experiment more by yourself when you're
| done with the lesson to discover what other arguments and colors are available. (If you can't wait to experiment, recall that swirl has play() and nxt()
| functions. At a command prompt, typing play() allows you to leave swirl temporarily so you can try different R commands at the console. Typing nxt() when
| you’re done playing brings you back to swirl and you can resume your lesson.)

...
  |====================================                                                                                                                  |  24%
| Now you'll see how easy it is to generate a multipanel plot using a single lattice command.

...
  |======================================                                                                                                                |  25%
| Run xyplot with the formula Ozone~Wind | as.factor(Month) as the first argument and the second argument data set equal to airquality (use the up arrow to
| save typing). So far, not much is different, right? Add a third argument, layout, set equal to c(5,1).

> xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | as.factor(Month), data = airquality, pch=8, col="red", main="Big Apple Data", layout=c(5,1))

| Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | as.factor(Month), data = airquality, layout=c(5,1)) at the command prompt.

> xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | as.factor(Month), data = airquality, layout=c(5,1)) 

| That's correct!
  |========================================                                                                                                              |  27%
| Note that the default color and plotting character are back. What did the as.factor(Month) do?

1: Huh?
2: Randomly divided the data into 5 panels
3: Displayed the data by individual months
4: Displayed and labeled each subplot with the month's integer

Selection: 4

| You got it!
  |===========================================                                                                                                           |  28%
| Since Month is a named column of the airquality dataframe we had to tell R to treat it as a factor. To see how this affects the plot, rerun the xyplot
| command you just ran, but use Ozone ~ Wind | Month instead of Ozone ~ Wind | as.factor(Month) as the first argument.

> xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | Month, data = airquality, layout=c(5,1))

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!
  |=============================================                                                                                                         |  30%
| Not as informative, right? The word Month in each panel really doesn't tell you much if it doesn't identify which month it's plotting. Notice that the actual
| data is the same between the two plots, though.

...
  |===============================================                                                                                                       |  31%
| Lattice functions behave differently from base graphics functions in one critical way. Recall that base graphics functions plot data directly to the graphics
| device (e.g., screen, or file such as a PDF file). In contrast, lattice graphics functions return an object of class trellis.

...
  |=================================================                                                                                                     |  33%
| The print methods for lattice functions actually do the work of plotting the data on the graphics device. They return "plot objects" that can be stored (but
| it’s usually better to just save the code and data). On the command line, trellis objects are auto-printed so that it appears the function is plotting the
| data.

...
  |===================================================                                                                                                   |  34%
| To see this, create a variable p which is assigned the output of this simple call to xyplot, xyplot(Ozone~Wind,data=airquality).

> p <- xyplot(Ozone~Wind, data=airquality )

| You are doing so well!
  |======================================================                                                                                                |  36%
| Nothing plotted, right? But the object p is around.

...
  |========================================================                                                                                              |  37%
| Type p or print(p) now to see it.

> print(p)

| Keep up the great work!
  |==========================================================                                                                                            |  39%

| We see that the trellis object p has 45 named properties, the first of which is "formula" which isn't too surprising. A lot of these properties are probably
| NULL in value. We've done some behind-the-scenes work for you and created two vectors. The first, mynames, is a character vector of the names in p. The
| second is a boolean vector, myfull, which has TRUE values for nonnull entries of p. Run mynames[myfull] to see which entries of p are not NULL.

| Not surprising, is it? It's a familiar formula. Now look at p's x.limits. Remember the double square brackets and quotes.

  |===================================================================                                                                                   |  45%
| They match the plot, right? The x values are indeed between .37 and 22.03.

...
  |=====================================================================                                                                                 |  46%
| Again, not surprising. Before we wrap up, let's talk about lattice's panel functions which control what happens inside each panel of the plot. The ease of
| making multi-panel plots makes lattice very appealing. The lattice package comes with default panel functions, but you can customize what happens in each
| panel.

...
  |========================================================================                                                                              |  48%
| Panel functions receive the x and y coordinates of the data points in their panel (along with any optional arguments). To see this, we've created some data
| for you - two 100-long vectors, x and y. For its first 50 values y is a function of x, for the last 50 values, y is random. We've also defined a 100-long
| factor vector f which distinguishes between the first and last 50 elements of the two vectors. Run the R command table with f as it argument.

> table(f)
f
Group 1 Group 2 
     50      50 

| Excellent work!
  |==========================================================================                                                                            |  49%
| The first 50 entries of f are "Group 1" and the last 50 are "Group 2". Run xyplot with two arguments. The first is the formula y~x|f, and the second is
| layout set equal to c(2,1). Note that we're not providing an explicit data argument, so xyplot will look in the environment and see the x and y that we've
| generated for you.

> xyplot(y~x|f, layout= c(2,1))

| You're the best!
  |============================================================================                                                                          |  51%
| To understand this a little better look at the variable v1 we've created for you.

> v1
[1] -2.185287  1.101780 -2.716851  1.569850

| That's the answer I was looking for.
  |==============================================================================                                                                        |  52%
| The first two numbers are the range of the x values of Group 1 and the last two numbers are the range of y values of Group 1. See how they match the values
| of the left panel (Group 1) in the plot. Now look at v2 which holds the comparable numbers for Group 2.

> v2
[1] -1.6066772  2.2205197 -0.1605085  2.0341048

| You got it!

| Again, the values match the plot. That's reassuring. We've copied some code from the slides for you. To see it, type myedit("plot1.R"). This will open your
| editor and display the R code in it.

> myedit("plot1.R")

| The panel function has 3 arguments, x, y and ... . This last stands for all other arguments (such as graphical parameters) you might want to include. There
| are 2 lines in the panel function. Each invokes a panel method, the first to plot the data in each panel (panel.xyplot), the second to draw a horizontal line
| in each panel (panel.abline). Note the similarity of this last call to that of the base plotting function of the same name.

...
  |==========================================================================================                                                            |  60%
| We've defined a function for you, pathtofile, which takes a filename as its argument. This makes sure R can find the file on your computer. Now run the R
| command source with two arguments. The first is the call to pathtofile with the string "plot1.R" as its argument and the second is the argument local set
| equal to TRUE. This command will run the code contained in plot1.R within the swirl environment so you can see what it does.

> source(pathtofind("plot1.R"), local=TRUE)
Error in pathtofind("plot1.R") : could not find function "pathtofind"
