| In another lesson, we gave you an overview of the three plotting systems in R. In this lesson we'll focus on the third and newest plotting system in R,
| ggplot2.  As we did with the other two systems, we'll focus on creating graphics on the screen device rather than another graphics device.

  |======                                                                                                                        |   5%
| The ggplot2 package is an add-on package available from CRAN via install.packages(). (Don't worry, we've installed it for you already.) It is an
| implementation of The Grammar of Graphics, an abstract concept (as well as book) authored and invented by Leland Wilkinson and implemented by Hadley Wickham
| while he was a graduate student at Iowa State. The web site http://ggplot2.org provides complete documentation.

...

| A grammar of graphics represents an abstraction of graphics, that is, a theory of graphics which conceptualizes basic pieces from which you can build new
| graphics and graphical objects. The goal of the grammar is to “Shorten the distance from mind to page”. From Hadley Wickham's book we learn that

...
  |============                                                                                                                  |  10%
| The ggplot2 package "is composed of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. ... you can create new graphics that are
| precisely tailored for your problem." These components include aesthetics which are attributes such as colour, shape, and size, and geometric objects or
| geoms such as points, lines, and bars.

...

| Before we delve into details, let's review the other 2 plotting systems.

...
  |==================                                                                                                            |  15%
| Recall what you know about R's base plotting system. Which of the following does NOT apply to it?

1: Start with plot (or similar) function
2: Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
3: It is convenient and mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
4: Can easily go back once the plot has started (e.g., to adjust margins or correct a typo)

Selection: 4

| That's a job well done!
  |======================                                                                                                        |  17%
| Recall what you know about R's lattice plotting system. Which of the following does NOT apply to it?

1: Plots are created with a single function call (xyplot, bwplot, etc.)
2: Can always add to the plot once it is created
3: Margins and spacing are set automatically because entire plot is specified at once
4: Most useful for conditioning types of plots and putting many panels on one plot

| Excellent job!
  |=========================                                                                                                     |  20%
| If we told you that ggplot2 combines the best of base and lattice, that would mean it ...?

1: All of the others
2: Like lattice it allows for multipanels but more easily and intuitively
3: Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to annotate
4: Its default mode makes many choices for you (but you can customize!)

Selection: 1

| You are really on a roll!
  |============================                                                                                                  |  22%
| Yes, ggplot2 combines the best of base and lattice. It allows for multipanel (conditioning) plots (as lattice does) but also post facto annotation (as base
| does), so you can add titles and labels. It uses the low-level grid package (which comes with R) to draw the graphics. As part of its grammar philosophy,
| ggplot2 plots are composed of aesthetics (attributes such as size, shape, color) and geoms (points, lines, and bars), the geometric objects you see on the
| plot.

...
  |===============================                                                                                               |  24%
| The ggplot2 package has 2 workhorse functions. The more basic workhorse function is qplot, (think quick plot), which works like the plot function in the base
| graphics system. It can produce many types of plots (scatter, histograms, box and whisker) while hiding tedious details from the user. Similar to lattice
| functions, it looks for data in a data frame or parent environment.

...
  |==================================                                                                                            |  27%
| The more advanced workhorse function in the package is ggplot, which is more flexible and can be customized for doing things qplot cannot do. In this lesson
| we'll focus on qplot.

...
  |=====================================                                                                                         |  29%
| We'll start by showing how easy and versatile qplot is. First, let's look at some data which comes with the ggplot2 package. The mpg data frame contains fuel
| economy data for 38 models of cars manufactured in 1999 and 2008. Run the R command str with the argument mpg. This will give you an idea of what mpg
| contains.

> str(mpg)
Classes ‘tbl_df’, ‘tbl’ and 'data.frame':	234 obs. of  11 variables:
 $ manufacturer: chr  "audi" "audi" "audi" "audi" ...

| We see that there are 234 points in the dataset concerning 11 different characteristics of the cars. Suppose we want to see if there's a correlation between
| engine displacement (displ) and highway miles per gallon (hwy). As we did with the plot function of the base system we could simply call qplot with 3
| arguments, the first two are the variables we want to examine and the third argument data is set equal to the name of the dataset which contains them (in

| We see that there are 234 points in the dataset concerning 11 different characteristics of

> qplot(displ,hwy,data = mpg)

| Keep up the great work!

  |===========================================                                                                                   |  34%
| A nice scatterplot done simply, right? All the labels are provided. The first argument is
| shown along the x-axis and the second along the y-axis. The negative trend (increasing
| displacement and lower gas mileage) is pretty clear. Now suppose we want to do the same plot
| but this time use different colors to distinguish between the 3 factors (subsets) of
| different types of drive (drv) in the data (front-wheel, rear-wheel, and 4-wheel). Again,
| qplot makes this very easy. We'll just add what ggplot2 calls an aesthetic, a fourth
| argument, color, and set it equal to drv. Try this now. (Use the up arrow key to save some
| typing.)

> qplot(displ,hwy,data = mpg, color= "drv")

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Type qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv) at the command prompt.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv) 

| Excellent work!

  |==============================================                                                                                |  37%
| Pretty cool, right? See the legend to the right which qplot helpfully supplied? The colors
| were automatically assigned by qplot so the legend decodes the colors for you. Notice that
| qplot automatically used dots or points to indicate the data. These points are geoms
| (geometric objects). We could have used a different aesthetic, for instance shape instead of
| color, to distinguish between the drive types.

...

  |=================================================                                                                             |  39%
| Now let's add a second geom to the default points. How about some smoothing function to
| produce trend lines, one for each color? Just add a fifth argument, geom, and using the R
| function c(), set it equal to the concatenation of the two strings "point" and "smooth". The
| first refers to the data points and second to the trend lines we want plotted. Try this now.

> 
> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, geom=c("point","smooth")) 
`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess'

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |====================================================                                                                          |  41%
| Notice the gray areas surrounding each trend lines. These indicate the 95% confidence
| intervals for the lines.

...

  |=======================================================                                                                       |  44%
| Before we leave qplot's scatterplotting ability, call qplot again, this time with 3
| arguments. The first is y set equal to hwy, the second is data set equal to mpg, and the
| third is color set equal to drv. Try this now.

> qplot(y= hwy, data = mpg, color = drv) 

| That's a job well done!

  |==========================================================                                                                    |  46%
| What's this plot showing? We see the x-axis ranges from 0 to 250 and we remember that we had
| 234 data points in our set, so we can infer that each point in the plot represents one of
| the hwy values (indicated by the y-axis). We've created the vector myhigh for you which
| contains the hwy data from the mpg dataset. Look at myhigh now.

| Nice work!

  |=============================================================                                                                 |  49%
| Comparing the values of myhigh with the plot, we see the first entries in the vector (29,
| 29, 31, 30,...) correspond to the leftmost points in the the plot (in order), and the last
| entries in myhigh (28, 29, 26, 26, 26) correspond to the rightmost plotted points. So,
| specifying the y parameter only, without an x argument, plots the values of the y argument
| in the order in which they occur in the data.

...

  |=================================================================                                                             |  51%
| The all-purpose qplot can also create box and whisker plots.  Call qplot now with 4
| arguments. First specify the variable by which you'll split the data, in this case drv, then
| specify the variable which you want to examine, in this case hwy. The third argument is data
| (set equal to mpg), and the fourth, the geom, set equal to the string "boxplot"

> qplot(drv,hwy, data = mpg, geom = "boxplot") 

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |====================================================================                                                          |  54%
| We see 3 boxes, one for each drive. Now to impress you, call qplot with 5 arguments. The
| first 4 are just as you used previously, (drv, hwy, data set equal to mpg, and geom set
| equal to the string "boxplot"). Now add a fifth argument, color, equal to manufacturer.

> qplot(drv,hwy, data = mpg, geom = "boxplot", color= manufacturer) 

| You are amazing!

  |=======================================================================                                                       |  56%
| It's a little squished but we just wanted to illustrate qplot's capabilities. Notice that
| there are still 3 regions of the plot (determined by the factor drv). Each is subdivided
| into several boxes depicting different manufacturers.

...

  |==========================================================================                                                    |  59%
| Now, on to histograms. These display frequency counts for a single variable. Let's start
| with an easy one. Call qplot with 3 arguments. First specify the variable for which you want
| the frequency count, in this case hwy, then specify the data (set equal to mpg), and
| finally, the aesthetic, fill, set equal to drv. Instead of a plain old histogram, this will
| again use colors to distinguish the 3 different drive factors.

> qplot(hwy,data=mpg,fill =drv)
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

| You're the best!

  |=============================================================================                                                 |  61%
| See how qplot consistently uses the colors. Red (if 4-wheel drv is in the bin) is at the
| bottom of the bin, then green on top of it (if present), followed by blue (rear wheel drv).
| The color lets us see right away that 4-wheel drive vehicles in this dataset don't have gas
| mileages exceeding 30 miles per gallon.

...

  |================================================================================                                              |  63%
| It's cool that qplot can do this so easily, but some people may find this multi-color
| histogram hard to interpret. Instead of using colors to distinguish between the drive
| factors let's use facets or panels. (That's what lattice called them.) This just means we'll
| split the data into 3 subsets (according to drive) and make 3 smaller individual plots of
| each subset in one plot (and with one call to qplot).

...

  |===================================================================================                                           |  66%
| Remember that with base plot we had to do each subplot individually. The lattice system made
| plotting conditioning plots easier. Let's see how easy it is with qplot.

...

  |======================================================================================                                        |  68%
| We'll do two plots, a scatterplot and then a histogram, each with 3 facets. For the
| scatterplot, call qplot with 4 arguments. The first two are displ and hwy and the third is
| the argument data set equal to mpg. The fourth is the argument facets which will be set
| equal to the expression . ~ drv which is ggplot2's shorthand for number of rows (to the left
| of the ~) and number of columns (to the right of the ~). Here the . indicates a single row
| and drv implies 3, since there are 3 distinct drive factors. Try this now.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg,facets= .~drv)

| Excellent job!

| The result is a 1 by 3 array of plots. Note how each is labeled at the top with the factor
| label (4,f, or r). This shows us more detailed information than the histogram. We see the
| relationship between displacement and highway mileage for each of the 3 drive factors.

| Now we'll do a histogram, again calling qplot with 4 arguments. This time, since we need
| only one variable for a histogram, the first is hwy and the second is the argument data set
| equal to mpg. The third is the argument facets which we'll set equal to the expression drv ~
| . . This will give us a different arrangement of the facets. The fourth argument is
| binwidth. Set this equal to 2. Try this now.

> qplot( hwy, data=mpg,facets=drv~. ,binwidth=2  )

| All that practice is paying off!
