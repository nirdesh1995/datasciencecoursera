| Hi! I see that you have some variables saved in your workspace. To keep things running smoothly, I recommend you clean up before starting swirl.

| Type ls() to see a list of the variables in your workspace. Then, type rm(list=ls()) to clear your workspace.

| Type swirl() when you are ready to begin.

| Whenever you're working with a new dataset, the first thing you should do is look at it! What is the format of the data? What are the dimensions?
| What are the variable names? How are the variables stored? Are there missing data? Are there any flaws in the data?

...
  |======                                                                                                                                       |   4%
| This lesson will teach you how to answer these questions and more using R's built-in functions. We'll be using a dataset constructed from
| the United States Department of Agriculture's PLANTS Database (http://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html).

...
  |===========                                                                                                                                  |   8%
| I've stored the data for you in a variable called plants. Type ls() to list the variables in your workspace, among which should be plants.

> ls()
[1] "cnames"     "my_data"    "my_matrix"  "my_matrix2" "my_vector"  "patients"   "plants"    

| That's correct!
  |=================                                                                                                                            |  12%
| Let's begin by checking the class of the plants variable with class(plants). This will give us a clue as to the overall structure of the
| data.

> class(plants)
[1] "data.frame"

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!
  |=======================                                                                                                                      |  16%
| It's very common for data to be stored in a data frame. It is the default class for data read into R using functions like read.csv() and
| read.table(), which you'll learn about in another lesson.

...
  |============================                                                                                                                 |  20%
| Since the dataset is stored in a data frame, we know it is rectangular. In other words, it has two dimensions (rows and columns) and fits
| neatly into a table or spreadsheet. Use dim(plants) to see exactly how many rows and columns we're dealing with.

> dim(plants)
[1] 5166   10

| You got it right!
  |==================================                                                                                                           |  24%
| The first number you see (5166) is the number of rows (observations) and the second number (10) is the number of columns (variables).

...
  |=======================================                                                                                                      |  28%
| You can also use nrow(plants) to see only the number of rows. Try it out.

> nrow(plants)
[1] 5166

| Excellent job!
  |=============================================                                                                                                |  32%
| ... And ncol(plants) to see only the number of columns.

> ncol(plants)
[1] 10

| Excellent work!
  |===================================================                                                                                          |  36%
| If you are curious as to how much space the dataset is occupying in memory, you can use object.size(plants).

> object.size(plants)
644232 bytes

| That's a job well done!
  |========================================================                                                                                     |  40%
| Now that we have a sense of the shape and size of the dataset, let's get a feel for what's inside. names(plants) will return a character
| vector of column (i.e. variable) names. Give it a shot.

> names(plants)
 [1] "Scientific_Name"      "Duration"             "Active_Growth_Period" "Foliage_Color"        "pH_Min"               "pH_Max"              
 [7] "Precip_Min"           "Precip_Max"           "Shade_Tolerance"      "Temp_Min_F"          

| Perseverance, that's the answer.
  |==============================================================                                                                               |  44%
| We've applied fairly descriptive variable names to this dataset, but that won't always be the case. A logical next step is to peek at the
| actual data. However, our dataset contains over 5000 observations (rows), so it's impractical to view the whole thing all at once.

...	
  |====================================================================                                                                         |  48%
| The head() function allows you to preview the top of the dataset. Give it a try with only one argument.

> head()
Error in head.default() : argument "x" is missing, with no default
> head(10)
[1] 10

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| head(plants) will show you the very top of the dataset.

| Take a minute to look through and understand the output above. Each row is labeled with the observation number and each column with the
| variable name. Your screen is probably not wide enough to view all 10 columns side-by-side, in which case R displays as many columns as it
| can on each line before continuing on the next.

...

| By default, head() shows you the first six rows of the data. You can alter this behavior by passing as a second argument the number of rows
| you'd like to view. Use head() to preview the first 10 rows of plants.

| summary() provides different output for each variable, depending on its class. For numeric data such as Precip_Min, summary() displays the
| minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum. These values help us understand how the data are distributed.

| For categorical variables (called 'factor' variables in R), summary() displays the number of times each value (or 'level') occurs in the
| data. For example, each value of Scientific_Name only appears once, since it is unique to a specific plant. In contrast, the summary for
| Duration (also a factor variable) tells us that our dataset contains 3031 Perennial plants, 682 Annual plants, etc.

| You can see that R truncated the summary for Active_Growth_Period by including a catch-all category called 'Other'. Since it is a
| categorical/factor variable, we can see how many times each value actually occurs in the data with table(plants$Active_Growth_Period).

| The beauty of str() is that it combines many of the features of the other functions you've already seen, all in a concise and readable
| format. At the very top, it tells us that the class of plants is 'data.frame' and that it has 5166 observations and 10 variables. It then
| gives us the name and class of each variable, as well as a preview of its contents.

| str() is actually a very general function that you can use on most objects in R. Any time you want to understand the structure of something
| (a dataset, function, etc.), str() is a good place to start.

| In this lesson, you learned how to get a feel for the structure and contents of a new dataset using a collection of simple and useful
| functions. Taking the time to do this upfront can save you time and frustration later on in your analysis.
